        <ul>
            <li>Your favourite pasta shape. So long as it's bronze die extruded, you're in the clear! My go to is oricheti but you do you.</li>
            <li>Your favourite cheese - preferrably a good melter like mozza or cheddar.</li>
            <li>Salt or stock powder.</li>
            <li>A simple frozen veg so you don't get scruvy - I like to drop some pees in there.</li>
            <li>Butter.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The first step here is to understand that this ain't no run of the mill, boring ass mac and cheese. This is Dickie's Famous Mac n Cheese, and as such, there's going to be a special way of doing things.</li>
            <li>We're going to boil a kettle of water, more than you think you might need.</li>
            <li>From there, we're going to weigh out our pasta, 100-150 grams per person depending on how hungry you are.</li>
            <li>We're going to toss our weighed pasta onto the stove in a big pot with room for stirring.</li>
            <li>Once the water is boiling, put enough in the pot to cover the pasta, but no more! We can always add mroe later but we can't take it out.</li>
            <li>Crank the heat on the stove and start stirring - our low volume of water is going to make the pasta want to stick, we don't want that to happen.</li>
            <li>Continue stirring and adding water while the starches begin to form their own sauce.</li>
            <li>Once a starchy sauce has formed and the pasta is almost cooked through, toss in your butter.</li>
            <li>After the butter is melted, toss in your shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Once the cheese is incorporated, toss in your frozen veg and continue to stir until they have thawed.</li>
            <li>Eat your tasty pasta.</li>
        </ol>
